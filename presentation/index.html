    <h1>Introduction to GraphQL</h1>

    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
      GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those
      queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and
      understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the
      power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier
      to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Object types and fields</h2>
    <p>
      GraphQL uses a typed schema to define our data model.
    </p>

    <h3>Types</h3>
    <p>
      Types are the structure of our data. They define properties and this
      properties map to other types or scalar values. Scalar values on GraphQL
      are String, Boolean, Arrays, Int, Float, ID, and in some cases Date.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    type User {
      id: ID
      name: String!
      age: Int
      isEmployed: Boolean
      family: [User!]!
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      Lets have a better look at
      <code class="lang-graphql"> family:[User!]! </code>, the null operator.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
    family: null // invalid
    family: [] // valid
    family: [{ name: 'John', age: 32, ... }] // valid
    family: [{ name: 'John', age: 32, ... }, null, {...}] // invalid
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Meta fields</h3>
    <p>
      Meta fields are special properties on the object types that let us know
      more information about the type itself. this are <code> __schema </code>,
      <code> __type </code>.
    </p>

    <h3>Enumeration types</h3>
    <p>Like in other typed systems, you can enumerate valies like this.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    enum Houses {
     TARGARYEN
     STARK
     LANNISTER
     BARATHEON
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Fragments</h3>
    <p>
      Fragments let us define group of fields to use as return values. To create
      a fragment you need to speficy the type this fragment is going to be used
      on.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    fragment userFields on User {
      name
      age
      isEmployed
      family
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>You can also define inline fragments.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    ... on User {
      name
      age
      isEmployed
      family
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
    <p>Interfaces let you extend your model and reuse types.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    interface Animal{
     id: ID!
     numberOfLegs: Int! 
     color: String!
     race: String!
    }

    type Dog implements Animal {
      timesToEatADat: Int! 
    }

    type Cat implements Animal {
      likesWater: Boolean!
    }
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      You can use Interfaces as your return value, but you need to use fragments
      to retrieve particular fields on the implemented types.
    </p>

    <h3>Union types</h3>
    <p>
      Union types as the name implies is the way we define several types as a
      new type. Union needs to use concrete object types.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    union AnimalResult = Dog | Cat
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Input types</h3>
    <p>
      Inputs are a typed that let us pass a lot of properties into one object,
      and use them in queries and mutations. We can't use
      <code class="lang-graphql"> type </code> because they can have circular
      references and also use interfaces as part of their values.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
    input UserInput {
      name: String!
      age: Int!
      isEmployed: Boolean = true 
      family: [UserInput]
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Directives</h3>
    <p>
      Directives are a tool to manipulate the structure and the shape of a
      result. There are 2 built in directives
      <code class="lang-graphql"> @skip </code> and
      <code class="lang-graphql"> @include </code>. There is also the posibility
      to create your own.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    # Usage
    query GetUsers{
      users{
       id
       name
       isEmployed @include(if: $withDetail)
      }
    }

    #Variables
    {
      "withDetail": true  
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Query language</h2>
    <p>
      Like Sql, GraphQL has its own query language. It defines 3 types of
      operations.
    </p>

    <h3>Queries</h3>
    <p>Queries are the actions we use to retrieve information from our API.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    # Schema
    type Query {
      getUserById(id: ID!): User   
    }

    # Usage
    query GetUser($id: ID){             
      getUserById(id: $id){
        name
        isEmployed
      }
    }


    # Usage with fragment 
    query GetUser($id: ID){             
      getUserById(id: $id){
        ...userFields
      }
    }

    # Variables 
    {
      "id": 1234
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Mutations</h3>
    <p>Mutations are the actions we use to update our data.</p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    # Schema
    type Mutation {
      addUser(user: User)
    }

    # Usage
    mutation AddUser($user: User){
      addUser(user: $user){
        name
      }
    }

    # Variables 
    {
      "user":{
        "name": "David"
        "age": 28
        "isEmployed": true
        "family": []
      }
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
    <p>
      Subscriptions are a special operation that allow us to receive updates in
      real time.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    # Schema
    type Subscription {
      addedUser: User
    }

    # Usage
    subscription onUserAdded{
      addedUser{
        name
      }
    }
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      Subscriptions work like dispatched events being
      <code class="lang-graphql"> addedUser </code> the event and
      <code class="lang-graphql"> User </code> the data dispatched in the event.
    </p>

    <h2>Schema</h2>
    <p>
      The schema in GraphQL is very similar to the schema we use in ORMs. Is the
      entire definition of the data we are going to use, with the addition of
      the available operations (Queries, Mutations and Subscriptions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the previous example the schema definition would be something
      like this.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="lang-graphql">
    type Query {
      getUserById(id: ID!):User
      ...
    }

    type Mutation {
      addUser(user: User)	
      ...
    }

    type Subscription {
      addedUser: User
      ...
    }

    input UserInput {
      name: String!
      age: Int!
      isEmployed: Boolean = true 
      family: [UserInput]
    }

    type User {
      id: ID
      name: String!
      age: Int
      isEmployed: Boolean
      family: [User!]!
    }
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Runtime</h2>
    <p>
      Basically GraphQL defines the query language and what should a runtime
      needs to include but is up to the runtime provider to implement it, so
      that's why is language agnostic.
